# What is the issue?

The lack of scaling at the base layer of Bitcoin has caused unsustainable high fees and erratic confirmation times. Layer 2 solutions cannot scale Bitcoin unless the base layer also scales.


This lack of scaling has made Bitcoin uncompetitive in the real world. Bitcoin has lost support and merchant adoption has been delayed many years. It has placed a large question mark over Bitcoin as a solution.  


Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. Does it allow itself to scale? Or does it fade away into history? 

# What have we done? 

### 1. Provide a BIP to scale bitcoin.
We have provided a BIP we call BIPBBB (BIP Bigger Bitcoin Blocks). The BIP shows a way for bitcoin to scale it's blockweight. The BIP can be found here: BIPBBB.

### 2. Provide a referenece implementation.
We have provided a BIPBBB reference implementation based on the latest bitcoin-core releases ([0.20](https://github.com/oki-burokku/bitcoin/tree/0.20) & [0.19](https://github.com/oki-burokku/bitcoin/tree/0.19)). This refernece design has only minor differences to the bitcoin-core codebase. We will maintain this repository to match the latest core releases with the BIPBBB implementation. This reference implemenation could be used by miners or node operators to indicate support for and eventually generate bigger bitcoin blocks.   

# What can you do?

### Miners
If you are a miner, then run the BIPBBB code base & signal your voting intentions in any blocks you generate.

### Node Operators
If you are a node operator, then run the BIPBBB code base and signal your support for the BIPBBB protocol. 

### Hackers, Developers & Software Engineers
If you are able, review the BIPBBB propsal and suggest improvements. Or review the implmenations, suggest improvments, or provide more test cases.  

### Users
If you are a user now is the time to agitate for change.
