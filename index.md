# What is the issue?

The lack of scaling at the base layer of Bitcoin has caused unsustainable high fees and erratic confirmation times. Layer 2 solutions cannot scale Bitcoin unless the base layer also scales.


This lack of scaling has made Bitcoin uncompetitive in the real world. Bitcoin has lost support and merchant adoption has been delayed many years. It has placed a large question mark over Bitcoin as a solution.  


Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. Does it allow itself to scale? Or does it fade away into history? 

# What have we done? 

## 1. Provide a BIP to scale bitcoin.
We have provided a BIP we call BIPBBB (BIP Bigger Bitcoin Blocks). The BIP shows a way for bitcoin to scale it's blockweight. The BIP can be found here: BIPBBB.

## 2. Provide a referenece implementation.
We have provided a BIPBBB reference implementation based on the latest bitcoin-core releases (0.20 & 0.19). This refernece design has only minor differences to the bitcoin-core codebase. We will maintain this repositopry to match the latest core releases with the BIPBBB implementation. This reference implemenation could be used by miners or node operators to indicate support for and eventually generate bigger bitcoin blocks.
