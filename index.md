The lack of scaling at the base layer of Bitcoin has caused unsustainable high fees and erratic confirmation times. Layer 2 solutions cannot scale Bitcoin unless the base layer also scales.


This has made Bitcoin uncompetitive in the real world. Bitcoin has lost support and merchant adoption. The lack of scaling has delayed crypto adoption by many years and placed a large question mark over Bitcoin as a solution.  


Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. Does it allow itself to scale? Or does it fade away into history?
